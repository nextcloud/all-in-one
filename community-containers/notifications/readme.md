## Notifications
This container allows other AIO community containers to send admin notifications to Nextcloud users. 

### Notes
- It needs to be enabled for the [scrutiny container](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers/scrutiny) for example to make use of admin notifications that are sent if a smartctl failure was found.
- See https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/community-containers#community-containers how to add it to the AIO stack
