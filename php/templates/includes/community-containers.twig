<h2>Community Containers</h2>
<p>In this section you can enable or disable optional Community Containers that are not included by default in the main installation. These containers are provided by the community and can be useful for various purposes and are automatically integrated in AIOs backup solution and update mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>⚠️ Caution: </strong>Community Containers are maintained by the community and not officially by Nextcloud. Some containers may not be compatible with your system, may not work as expected or may discontinue. Use them at your own risk. Please read the documentation for each container first before adding any as some are also incompatible between each other! Never add all of them at the same time!</p>
