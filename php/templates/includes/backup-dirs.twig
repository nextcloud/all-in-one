The folder path that you enter must start with <strong>/</strong> and must <strong>not</strong> end with <strong>/</strong>.<br><br>
An example for Linux is <strong>/mnt/backup</strong>.<br><br>
On Synology it could be <strong>/volume1/docker/nextcloud/backup</strong>.<br><br>
For macOS it may be <strong>/var/backup</strong>.<br><br>
On Windows it might be <strong>/run/desktop/mnt/host/c/backup</strong>. (This path is equivalent to 'C:\backup' on your Windows host so you need to translate the path accordingly. Hint: the path that you enter needs to start with '/run/desktop/mnt/host/'. Append to that the exact location on your windows host, e.g. 'c/backup' which is equivalent to 'C:\backup'.) ⚠️ <strong>Please note</strong>: This does not work with external drives like USB or network drives and only with internal drives like SATA or NVME drives.<br><br>
Another option is to enter a specific volume name here: <strong>nextcloud_aio_backupdir</strong>. This volume needs to be created beforehand manually by you in order to be able to use it. See <a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-create-the-backup-volume-on-windows">this documentation</a> for an example.<br><br>
