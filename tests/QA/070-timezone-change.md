# Timezone change

- [ ] At the very bottom of the page you should see the timezone change section
- [ ] When the containers are stopped, you should be able to change it and set/reset it
- [ ] If not already set, it should show an input field where you can enter a timezone
- [ ] `Europe/Berlin` should be accepted, e.g. `Europe Berlin` not
- [ ] When it is set, it should show that it is set to which timezone and display a button that allows to reset it again which does this on a press
- [ ] When it is set, running `date` inside Nextcloud releated containers should return the correct timezone
