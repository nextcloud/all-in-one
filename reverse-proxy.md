# Reverse Proxy Documentation

**Note:** The maintainers of AIO noticed that this documentation is not easy. All contributions that improve this are very welcome!

A [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) is basically a web server that enables computers on the internet to access a service in a [private subnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network).

**Please note:** Publishing the AIO interface with a valid certificate to the public internet is **not** the goal of this documentation! Instead, the main goal is to publish Nextcloud with a valid certificate to the public internet which is **not** running inside the mastercontainer but in a different container! If you need a valid certificate for the AIO interface, see [point 5](#5-optional-get-a-valid-certificate-for-the-aio-interface).

In order to run Nextcloud behind a web server or reverse proxy (like Apache, Nginx, Cloudflare Tunnel and else), you need to specify the port that AIO's Apache container shall use, add a specific config to your web server or reverse proxy and modify the startup command a bit. All examples below will use port `11000` as example `APACHE_PORT` which will be exposed on the host to receive unencrypted HTTP traffic from the reverse proxy. **Advice:** If you need https between Nextcloud and the reverse proxy because it is running on a different server in the same network, simply add another reverse proxy to the chain that runs on the same server like AIO and takes care of https proxying (most likely via self-signed cert). Another option is to create a VPN between the server that runs AIO and the server that runs the reverse proxy which takes care of encrypting the connection.

**Attention:** The process to run Nextcloud behind a reverse proxy consists of at least steps 1, 2 and 4:
1. **Configure the reverse proxy! See [point 1](#1-configure-the-reverse-proxy)**
1. **Use this startup command! See [point 2](#2-use-this-startup-command)**
1. Optional: If the reverse proxy is installed on the same host and in the host network, you should limit the apache container to only listen on localhost. See [point 3](#3-limit-the-access-to-the-apache-container)
1. **Open the AIO interface. See [point 4](#4-open-the-aio-interface)**
1. Optional: Get a valid certificate for the AIO interface! See [point 5](#5-optional-get-a-valid-certificate-for-the-aio-interface)
1. Optional: How to debug things? See [point 6](#6-how-to-debug-things)

**Please note:** Since the Apache container gets created by the mastercontainer, there is **NO** way to provide custom docker labels or custom environmental variables for the Apache container. So please do not attempt to do this because you will fail! Only the documented way will work!

## 1. Configure the reverse proxy

### Adapting the sample web server configurations below
1. Replace `<your-nc-domain>` with the domain on which you want to run Nextcloud.
1. Adjust the port `11000` to match your chosen `APACHE_PORT`.
1. Adjust `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` to point to the Nextcloud server IP or domain depending on where the reverse proxy is running. See the following options.

    <details>

    <summary>On the same server without a container</summary>

    For this setup, the default sample configurations with `localhost:$APACHE_PORT` should work.

    </details>

    <details>

    <summary>On the same server in a Docker container</summary>

    For this setup, you can use as target `host.docker.internal:$APACHE_PORT` instead of `localhost:$APACHE_PORT`. **⚠️ Important:** In order to make this work on Docker for Linux, you need to add `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway` to the docker run command of your reverse proxy container or `extra_hosts: ["host.docker.internal:host-gateway"]` in docker compose (it works on Docker Desktop by default).

    Another option and actually the recommended way in this case is to use `--network host` option (or `network_mode: host` for docker-compose) as setting for the reverse proxy container to connect it to the host network. If you are using a firewall on the server, you need to open ports 80 and 443 for the reverse proxy manually. By doing so, the default sample configurations that point at `localhost:$APACHE_PORT` should work without having to modify them.

    </details>

    <details>

    <summary>On a different server (in container or not)</summary>

    Use the private ip-address of the host that shall be running AIO. So e.g. `private.ip.address.of.aio.server:$APACHE_PORT` instead of `localhost:$APACHE_PORT`.
    
    If you are not sure how to retrieve that, you can run: `ip a | grep "scope global" | head -1 | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's|/.*||'` on the server that shall be running AIO (the commands only work on Linux).

    </details>

### Apache

**Disclaimer:** It might be possible that the config below is not working 100% correctly, yet. Improvements to it are very welcome!

Add this as a new Apache site config:

(The config below assumes that you are using certbot to get your certificates. You need to create them first in order to make it work.)

### Caddy (Recommended)

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

Add this to your Caddyfile:

```
https://<your-nc-domain>:443 {
    reverse_proxy localhost:11000
}
```
The Caddyfile is a text file called `Caddyfile` (no extension) which – if you should be running Caddy inside a container – should usually be created in the same location as your `compose.yaml` file prior to starting the container.

⚠️ **Please note:** Look into [this](#adapting-the-sample-web-server-configurations-below) to adapt the above example configuration.

**Advice:** You may have a look at [this](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/575#discussion-4055615) for a more complete example.

### Caddy with ACME DNS-challenge

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

You can get AIO running using the ACME DNS-challenge. Here is how to do it.

1. Follow [this documentation](https://caddy.community/t/how-to-use-dns-provider-modules-in-caddy-2/8148) in order to get a Caddy build that is compatible with your domain provider's DNS challenge.
1. Add this to your Caddyfile:
    ```
    https://<your-nc-domain>:443 {
        reverse_proxy localhost:11000
        tls {
            dns <provider> <key>
        }
    }
    ```
    ⚠️ **Please note:** Look into [this](#adapting-the-sample-web-server-configurations-below) to adapt the above example configuration.

    You also need to adjust `<provider>` and `<key>` to match your case.

1. Now continue with [point 2](#2-use-this-startup-command) but additionally, add `--env SKIP_DOMAIN_VALIDATION=true` to the docker run command of the mastercontainer (but before the last line `nextcloud/all-in-one:latest`) which will disable the domain validation (because it is known that the domain validation will not work when using the DNS-challenge since no port is publicly opened).

**Advice:** In order to make it work in your home network, you may add the internal ipv4-address of your reverse proxy as A DNS-record to your domain and disable the dns-rebind-protection in your router. Another way it to set up a local dns-server like a pi-hole and set up a custom dns-record for that domain that points to the internal ip-adddress of your reverse proxy (see https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-can-i-access-nextcloud-locally). If both is not possible, you may add the domain to the hosts file which is needed then for any devices that shall use the server.

### Cloudflare Tunnel

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

Although it does not seem like it is the case but from AIO perspective a Cloudflare Tunnel works like a reverse proxy. Please see the [caveats](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#notes-on-cloudflare-proxytunnel) before proceeding. Here is then how to make it work:

1. Install the Cloudflare Tunnel on the same machine where AIO will be running on and point the Tunnel with the domain that you want to use for AIO to `http://localhost:11000`.<br>
⚠️ **Please note:** Look into [this](#adapting-the-sample-web-server-configurations-below) to adapt the above example configuration.
1. Now continue with [point 2](#2-use-this-startup-command) but additionally, add `--env SKIP_DOMAIN_VALIDATION=true` to the docker run command which will disable the domain validation (because it is known that the domain validation will not work behind a Cloudflare Tunnel). So you need to ensure yourself that you've configured everything correctly.

**Advice:** Make sure to [disable Cloudflares Rocket Loader feature](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/login-page-not-working-solved/149417/8) as otherwise Nextcloud's login prompt will not be shown.

First, please make sure that the environmental variables `PUID` and `PGID` in the compose.yaml file for NPM are either unset or set to `0`.
If you need to change the GID/PID then please add `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0` at the end of `/etc/sysctl.conf`. Note: this will cause that non root users can bind privileged ports.

Second, see these screenshots for a working config:

### Nginx-Proxy

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

Unfortunately it is not possible to configure nginx-proxy in a way that works because it completely relies on environmental variables of the docker containers itself. Providing these variables does not work as stated above.

If you really want to use AIO, we recommend you to switch to caddy. It is simply amazing!<br>
Of course understandable if that is not possible for you.

Apart from that, there is this: [manual-install](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/tree/main/manual-install)

### Node.js with Express

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

**Disclaimer:** It might be possible that the config below is not working 100% correctly, yet. Improvements to it are very welcome!

For Node.js, we will use the npm package `http-proxy`. WebSockets must be handled separately.

This example only uses `http`, but if your Express server already uses a `https` server, then follow the same instructions for `https`.

```js
const HttpProxy = require('http-proxy');
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');

const app = express();
const proxy = HttpProxy.createProxyServer({
	target: 'http://localhost:11000',
	// Timeout can be changed to your liking.
	timeout: 1000 * 60 * 3,
	proxyTimeout: 1000 * 60 * 3,
	// Not 100% certain whether autoRewrite is necessary, but enabling it SEEMS to make it behave more stably.
	autoRewrite: true,
	// Do not enable followRedirects.
	followRedirects: false,
});

// Handle errors with proxy.web and proxy.ws
function onProxyError(err, req, res, target) {
	// Handle errors however you like. Here's an example:
	if (err.code === 'ECONNREFUSED') {
		return res.status(503).send('Nextcloud server is currently not running. It may be down for temporary maintenance.');
	}
	// other errors
	else {
		console.error(err);
		return res.status(500).send(String(err));
	}
}

app.use((req, res) => {
	proxy.web(req, res, {}, onProxyError);
});

const httpServer = http.createServer(app);
httpServer.listen('80');

// Listen for an upgrade to a WebSocket connection.
httpServer.on('upgrade', (req, socket, head) => {
	proxy.ws(req, socket, head, {}, onProxyError);
});
```

If you are using the Express package `vhost` for your app, you can use `proxy.web` inside the vhosted express function (see the following code snippet), but `proxy.ws` still needs to be done "globally" on your http server. Nextcloud should automatically ignore websocket requests for other domains.

```js
const HttpProxy = require('http-proxy');
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');

const myNextcloudApp = express();
const myOtherApp = express();
const vhost = express();

// Definitions for proxy and onProxyError unchanged. (see above)

myNextcloudApp.use((req, res) => {
	proxy.web(req, res, {}, onProxyError);
});

vhost.use(vhostFunc('<your-nc-domain>', myNextcloudApp));

const httpServer = http.createServer(app);
httpServer.listen('80');

// Listen for an upgrade to a WebSocket connection.
httpServer.on('upgrade', (req, socket, head) => {
	proxy.ws(req, socket, head, {}, onProxyError);
});
```

### Traefik 2

<details>

<summary>click here to expand</summary>

**Disclaimer:** It might be possible that the config below is not working 100% correctly, yet. Improvements to it are very welcome!

Traefik's building blocks (router, service, middlewares) need to be defined using dynamic configuration similar to [this](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/file/#configuration-examples) official Traefik configuration example. Using **docker labels _won't work_** because of the nature of the project.

The examples below define the dynamic configuration in YAML files. If you rather prefer TOML, use a YAML to TOML converter.

1. In Traefik's static configuration define a [file provider](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/file/) for dynamic providers:

    ```yml
    # STATIC CONFIGURATION
   
    entryPoints:
      https:
        address: ":443" # Create an entrypoint called "https" that uses port 443
        # If you want to enable HTTP/3 support, uncomment the line below
        # http3: {}
    
    certificatesResolvers:
      # Define "letsencrypt" certificate resolver
      letsencrypt:
        acme:
          storage: /letsencrypt/acme.json # Defines the path where certificates should be stored
          email: <your-email-address> # Where LE sends notification about certificates expiring
          tlschallenge: true
   
    providers:
      file:
        directory: "/path/to/dynamic/conf" # Adjust the path according your needs.
        watch: true

    # Enable HTTP/3 feature by uncommenting the lines below. Don't forget to route 443 UDP to Traefik (Firewall\NAT\Traefik Container)
    # experimental:
      # http3: true
    ```

1. Declare the router, service and middlewares for Nextcloud in `/path/to/dynamic/conf/nextcloud.yml`:

    ```yml
    http:
      routers:
        nextcloud:
          rule: "Host(`<your-nc-domain>`)"
          entrypoints:
            - "https"
          service: nextcloud
          middlewares:
            - nextcloud-chain
          tls:
            certresolver: "letsencrypt"

      services:
        nextcloud:
          loadBalancer:
            servers:
              - url: "http://localhost:11000" # Use the host's IP address if Traefik runs outside the host network

      middlewares:
        nextcloud-secure-headers:
          headers:
            hostsProxyHeaders:
              - "X-Forwarded-Host"
            referrerPolicy: "same-origin"

        https-redirect:
          redirectscheme:
            scheme: https 

        nextcloud-chain:
          chain:
            middlewares:
              # - ... (e.g. rate limiting middleware)
              - https-redirect
              - nextcloud-secure-headers
    ```

## 2. Use this startup command

After adjusting your reverse proxy config, use the following command to start AIO:<br>

(For a docker-compose example, see the example further [below](#inspiration-for-a-docker-compose-file).)

```
# For Linux:
sudo docker run \
--init \
--sig-proxy=false \
--name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer \
--restart always \
--publish 8080:8080 \
--env APACHE_PORT=11000 \
--env APACHE_IP_BINDING=0.0.0.0 \
--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config \
--volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
nextcloud/all-in-one:latest
```

Note: You may be interested in adjusting Nextcloud’s datadir to store the files in a different location than the default docker volume. See [this documentation](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-change-the-default-location-of-nextclouds-datadir) on how to do it.

You should also think about limiting the apache container to listen only on localhost in case the reverse proxy is running on the same host and in the host network, by providing an additional environmental variable to this docker run command. See [point 3](#3-limit-the-access-to-the-apache-container).

On macOS see https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-run-aio-on-macos.

<details>

<summary>Command for Windows</summary>

On Windows, install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (and don't forget to [enable ipv6](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/blob/main/docker-ipv6-support.md) if you should need that) and run the following command in the command prompt:

```
docker run ^
--init ^
--sig-proxy=false ^
--name nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer ^
--restart always ^
--publish 8080:8080 ^
--env APACHE_PORT=11000 ^
--env APACHE_IP_BINDING=0.0.0.0 ^
--volume nextcloud_aio_mastercontainer:/mnt/docker-aio-config ^
--volume //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro ^
nextcloud/all-in-one:latest
```

Also, you may be interested in adjusting Nextcloud's Datadir to store the files on the host system. See [this documentation](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-change-the-default-location-of-nextclouds-datadir) on how to do it.

On Synology DSM see https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-run-aio-on-synology-dsm

### Inspiration for a docker-compose file

Simply translate the docker run command into a docker-compose file. You can have a look at [this file](https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/blob/main/compose.yaml) for some inspiration but you will need to modify it either way. You can find further examples here: https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one/discussions/588

## 3. Limit the access to the apache container

Use this environment variable during the initial startup of the mastercontainer to make the apache container only listen on localhost: `--env APACHE_IP_BINDING=127.0.0.1`. **Attention:** This is only recommended to be set if you use `localhost` in your reverse proxy config to connect to your AIO instance. If you use an ip-address instead of localhost, you should set it to `0.0.0.0`.

## 4. Open the AIO interface.
After starting AIO, you should be able to access the AIO Interface via `https://ip.address.of.the.host:8080`.<br>
⚠️ **Important:** do always use an ip-address if you access this port and not a domain as HSTS might block access to it later! (It is also expected that this port uses a self-signed certificate due to security concerns which you need to accept in your browser)<br>
Enter your domain in the AIO interface that you've used in the reverse proxy config and you should be done. Please do not forget to open/forward port `3478/TCP` and `3478/UDP` in your firewall/router for the Talk container!

## 5. Optional: get a valid certificate for the AIO interface

If you want to also access your AIO interface publicly with a valid certificate, you can add e.g. the following config to your Caddyfile:

```
https://<your-nc-domain>:8443 {
    reverse_proxy https://localhost:8080 {
        transport http {
            tls_insecure_skip_verify
        }
    }
}
```
⚠️ **Please note:** Look into [this](#adapting-the-sample-web-server-configurations-below) to adapt the above example configuration.

Afterwards should the AIO interface be accessible via `https://ip.address.of.the.host:8443`. You can alternatively change the domain to a different subdomain by using `https://<your-alternative-domain>:443` instead of `https://<your-nc-domain>:8443` in the Caddyfile and use that to access the AIO interface.

## 6. How to debug things?
If something does not work, follow the steps below:
1. Make sure to exactly follow the whole reverse proxy documentation step-for-step from top to bottom!
1. Make sure that you used the docker run command that is described in this reverse proxy documentation. **Hint:** make sure that you have set the `APACHE_PORT` via e.g. `--env APACHE_PORT=11000` during the docker run command!
1. Make sure to set the `APACHE_IP_BINDING` variable correctly. If in doubt, set it to `--env APACHE_IP_BINDING=0.0.0.0`
1. Make sure that all ports to which your reverse proxy is pointing match the chosen `APACHE_PORT`.
1. Make sure to follow [this](#adapting-the-sample-web-server-configurations-below) to adapt the example configurations to your specific setup
1. Make sure that the mastercontainer is able to spawn other containers. You can do so by checking that the mastercontainer indeed has access to the Docker socket which might not be positioned in one of the suggested directories like `/var/run/docker.sock` but in a different directory, based on your OS and the way how you installed Docker. The mastercontainer logs should help figuring this out. You can have a look at them by running `sudo docker logs nextcloud-aio-mastercontainer` after the container is started the first time.
1. Check if after the mastercontainer was started, the reverse proxy if running inside a container, can reach the provided apache port. You can test this by running `nc -z localhost 11000; echo $?` from inside the reverse proxy container. If the output is `0`, everything works. Alternatively you can of course use instead of `localhost` the ip-address of the host here for the test.
1. Make sure that you are not behind CGNAT. If that is the case, you will not be able to open ports properly. In that case you might use a Cloudflare Tunnel.
1. If you use Cloudflare, you might need to skip the domain validation anyways since it is known that Cloudflare might block the validation attempts. In that case, see the last option below.
1. If your reverse proxy is configured to use the host network (as recommended in the above docs) or running on the host, make sure that you've configured your firewall to open port 443 and 80.
1. Check if you have a public IPv4- and public IPv6-address. If you only have a public IPv6-address (e.g. due to DS-Lite), make sure to enable IPv6 in Docker and your whole networking infrastructure (e.g. also by adding an AAAA DNS-entry to your domain).
1. Try to configure everything from scratch if it still does not work by following https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#how-to-properly-reset-the-instance.
1. As last resort, you may disable the domain validation by adding `--env SKIP_DOMAIN_VALIDATION=true` to the docker run command. But only use this if you are completely sure that you've correctly configured everything!
